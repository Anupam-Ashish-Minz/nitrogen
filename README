NITROGEN:

Webpage: http://www.minuslab.net/code/nitrogen/


Requirements:

GTKMM 2.8
GTK 2.10


Installation:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install (as root or a user with proper permissions)

The binary is called, amazingly enough, "nitrogen".



Usage:  nitrogen [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

Options:
        --no-recurse
                Do not recurse into subdirectories
        --restore
                Restore saved backgrounds
        --sort=[arg]
                How to sort the backgrounds. Valid options are:
                        * alpha, for alphanumeric sort
                        * ralpha, for reverse alphanumeric sort
                        * time, for last modified time sort (oldest first)
                        * rtime, for reverse last modified time sort (newest first)

DIRECTORY is the directory containing the backgrounds you wish to preview.  It
adds files recursively from here (so long as --no-recurse hasn't been supplied),
generating preview images asynchronously.

If you want to tell us about the many bugs that we have, drop by #gentoo.et on
irc.freenode.net, and talk to nightm4re or syscrash2k.
